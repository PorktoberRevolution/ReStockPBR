# ReStockPBR

This mod is a derivative of the original [ReStock and ReStock+ projects](https://github.com/PorktoberRevolution/ReStocked). It brings several core features
- Parametrically based shading (PBR) materials and reauthored textures to most KSP and KSP MH parts
- A team color solution allowing recoloring of all parts we have worked on
- Additional new part replacements compared to base restock (Mk2 parts and a few others)
- Several new Restock+ parts

## Caution and Warning

This mod is in a highly alpha state. Things are not done and may break without warning. Not all parts are completed, `worklist.md` contains the current scope
